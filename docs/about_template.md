# Using `create-ros-app`

This repository was initialized by the [create-ros-app](https://github.com/UrbanMachine/create-ros-app) template.
This template is a everything-but-the-robot-code starter for ROS projects. It includes a Dockerfile for building ROS packages, a GitHub Actions workflow for linting and autoformatting, and many other goodies.

This documentation walks through the features of the template, and how to use them.

**Make sure to follow the [Post-Set-Up Guide](https://github.com/UrbanMachine/create-ros-app/blob/main/README.md#post-set-up-guide) after setting up the template before diving into the features below!**

## Quick Start Guide

Here's a quick guide on the features of this template

### Scripts
- Linting and autoformatting for python (ruff), C++ (clangformat), bash (shellcheck)
  
  **Relevant Scripts:**
  ```shell
  poetry run lint --help
  ```
  You may need to run `poetry lock` and `poetry install` before running the above command.
- Easily build ROS apps in an out-of-the box containerized environment, with helper scripts under the `docker/` directory.
  
  **Relevant Scripts:**
  ```shell
  # Run a profile specified under `launch-profiles/`
  docker/launch <profile>
  
  # Run and enter a new ROS container without executing anything
  docker/run
  
  # Enter a currently running ROS container to poke around
  docker/exec
  
  # Rebuild and restart the ROS nodes in the container, useful for fast development
  docker/reload-ros-nodes
  ```
  
  More usage examples for the above scripts are documented at the top of the script files.

### Things You Likely Want To Do

- **Create a new package**: It's recommended to just start by developing with the example package that comes with the
    template after generation. Once you're familiar with development with the template and want to create a second package,
    you can follow the steps under [Adding a New Package](#adding-a-new-package).
- **Add new dependencies:**
  - **System dependencies:** can be added under `docker/Dockerfile`, under the `install-packages` section.
  - **Python dependencies:** can be added under `pkgs/<package_name>/pyproject.toml`. Run `poetry lock` after.
  - **ROS dependencies:** can be added under `pkgs/<package_name>/package.xml`.
  - **ROS Git dependencies:** If you need to add a ROS package that isn't available in the ROS package index, you can add it as a git dependency in the `docker/Dockerfile` under the `Add Git ROS2 Packages` section.
  
  After any changes, the container will automatically re-build on the next launch.
- **Save persistent data:** The `/robot/persistent` directory is mounted to `.docker_volumes/ros-nodes/` on your local machine. Save data there to persist across container runs, and to view it in your file manager.
- **Look at logs:** Logs are available at `http://localhost/` after running `docker/launch <profile>`.
- **Create a new Launch Profile:**
  - Add a directory under `docker/launch-profiles/`
  - Add a `launching.py` file that launches your ROS nodes inside your new profile directory
  - Fill out the `launching.py` file with the nodes you want to launch.
  - The directory you created will be mounted under `/robot/launch-profile/` at launch. This is a great place to store configuration files, URDFs, and other specifics for your launch profile.


## Container Structure

### `/robot` Directory

The `/robot` directory is where your source code lives after building the container.
You can find your:
 - `pkgs/` directory
 - `build/`, `install/` from the colcon build

### `/robot/launch-profile/` Directory
A directory pointing towards the launch profile chosen in `docker/launch <launch profile>`
is mounted under `/robot/launch-profile/`. 

### `/robot/persistent/` Directory
For saving persistent data, `/robot/persistent` is mounted to `.docker_volumes/ros-nodes/` on your local machine.
This is a great place to save any serialized data, databases, etc. For static configuration,
it's recommended to use the `launch-profile` directory.

### `/ros-git-deps/` Directory

In the `Dockerfile`, there's a section for adding ROS packages that aren't available in 
the ROS package index. These are added as git dependencies. The `ros-git-deps/` 
directory is where these packages are cloned to, and built.


## Project Structure

### `pkgs/`

The packages directory contains all the packages that are used in the project. Each package is added in the `Dockerfile`, and any new packages should be added there as well.

#### Python Package structure
Each python package is made up of:
- A `resource` directory, which is a colcon requirement
- A `package.xml` file, which is a colcon requirement
- A `pyproject.toml`, because this project uses [colcon-poetry-ros](https://github.com/UrbanMachine/colcon-poetry-ros) to install project dependencies. Most ROS python packages use `setup.py`, but by using this plugin, we can use a modern python tool called [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies.
- A directory for code
- A directory for tests

##### Test directories

As (arbitrary) best practice, the example node uses a test directory that follows the following structure

```shell

package_name/
├── package_name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── node.py
├── package_name_test/
│   ├── unit/ 
│   │   ├── test_node.py
│   ├── integration/
│   │   ├── test_node.py

```

Essentially, tests exist in a parallel directory to the package, and are split into `unit` and `integration` tests. The directories within `unit` and `integration` mirror the structure of the package itself, except that module names are prefixed with `test_`.

#### Message Package Structure

The template will generate a message package for you with an `ExampleAction`, `ExampleService`, and `ExampleMessage`. You can add more messages by adding them to the `msg` directory and updating the `CMakeLists.txt` and `package.xml` files.

This can be used as a place for you to store your messages used just for this project. It follows standard ROS2 message package structure.

### `.github/`

This project uses poetry for linting, and has some code for running linting and autoformatting under `.github/lint`.
Run `poetry install` then enter the shell via `poetry shell` to get access to the linting tool.

This project is based on a template, upstream changes can be found on the [template repository](https://github.com/UrbanMachine/create-ros-app).
A tool called `cruft` will alert you when there are upstream changes, and help you merge those in.

### `docker/`

This directory contains scripts for building and running the Docker container. Look at the [Fancy Features](#fancy-features) section for more information on how to use these scripts.

As for the structure:

```shell
docker/
├── grafana/   # Stores Grafana provisioning configuration
├── promtail/  # Stores Promtail provisioning configuration
├── utils/     # Contains utility scripts for building or running inside the Docker container
│   ├── environment/  # Scripts for use during Dockerfile build
│   ├── runtime/      # Helper for use when using the docker container
```

#### `docker/Dockerfile`

Feel free to edit as you like, but it's recommended to stick to editing within the sections
blocked off by `#######`. 

The Dockerfile will need to be edited in two places for each new ROS package you add:


1. Copying in the `package.xml`
2. Copying in the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`

There's also a location for adding new `apt` dependencies. It's recommended that ROS package
dependencies are added through `package.xml` if they are available.

### `.env`

This file holds environment variables that are used by the docker build and launch scripts.

Most variables can safely be edited.

### `.docker_volumes/`

This directory is automatically created the first time you run `docker/launch`. It holds persistent state across runs for containers. 

For example, if you enter your container via `docker/run` and save a file under `/robot/persistent/`, that file will be available the next time you run `docker/run`. It will also (by default) exist in your local machine under `.docker_volumes/ros-nodes/`.
The `/robot/persistent` directory is intended for you, the developer, to use. So have at it!

## `.gitattributes`

The `.gitattributes` file is used to configure common binary file formats that are used in 
robots such that git uses Large File Storage (LFS) to store them. It also specified certain
line endings so that docker support works on windows.

# Adding a New Package

It's recommended to start by developing with the example package that comes with the
template after generation. Once you're familiar with development with the template and want to create a second package,
you can follow the steps below:

1. Create a new package directory under `pkgs/`
2. Add a `package.xml` file to the package directory, follow the standard ROS2 package.xml format
3. Create a pyproject.toml file. Follow the example in the `example_package` directory.
4. Create a `resource` directory in the package directory, with an empty file in it called `{your package name}`
5. Create a directory for your code in the package directory, and it's recommended to create a `{your_package_name}_test` directory as well.
6. Add a few things to the Dockerfile:
    - Under the `Add package.xml's of each package` section, copy the `package.xml` file into the container
    - Under the `Add pyproject.toml's of each package` section, copy the `pyproject.toml` file into the container

You should be good to go! Next time you run `docker/launch`, your new package will be built and available in the container.
